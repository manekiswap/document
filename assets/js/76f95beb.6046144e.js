Because Ethereum transactions occur in an adversarial environment, naively written smart contracts can, and will, be exploited for profit. For example, suppose a smart contract checks the asset ratio in a Uniswap pool at runtime and trades against it, assuming that the ratio represents the "fair" or "market" price of these assets. In that case, it is highly vulnerable to manipulation. A malicious actor could, e.g., trivially insert transactions before and after the naive transaction (a so-called "sandwich" attack), causing the smart contract to trade at a radically worse price, profit from this at the trader\'s expense, and then return the contracts to their original state, all at a low cost. (One important caveat is that these types of attacks are mitigated by trading in highly liquid pools, or at low values.)'),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"The best way to protect against these attacks is to introduce a price oracle. An oracle is any device that returns desired information, in this case, a pair's spot price. The best \"oracle\" is simply a traders' off-chain observation of the prevailing price, which can be passed into the trade as a safety check. This strategy is best suited to retail trading venues where users initiate transactions on their own behalf. However, it is often the case that a trusted price observation is not available (e.g., in multi-step, programmatic interactions involving Uniswap). Without a price oracle, these interactions will be forced to trade at whatever the (potentially manipulated) rate on Uniswap is.
