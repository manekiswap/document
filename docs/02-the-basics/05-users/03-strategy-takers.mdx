    Takers do not trade directly in the market. Instead, takers deposit their
    assets in the Maneki pool, and our computers will oversee all trading
    activities using a model of their choosing. Takers will not be charged a
    monthly cost; instead, the strategy usage price will be deducted from the
    earnings of the allotted strategy. Trading in Virtual Assets involves a
    significant level of risk to the capital of the taker. Takers should only
    invest money in strategies that fix their investment plan.
