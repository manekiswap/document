  <p>
    Management funds/traders/marketers are companies/individuals with a proven
    investment strategy who are looking to expand their portfolio by acquiring
    funds from investors. The profit generated as a consequence of the technique
    is split evenly among the makers, takers, and the Maneki platform. Strategy
    creators are paid a profit-only commission rather than a management
    commission (success fee). The charge will be removed immediately from a
    share of the profit earned by the strategies, and the structure is entirely
    performance-based.
