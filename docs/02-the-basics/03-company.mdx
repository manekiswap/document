  <p>
    Maneki is a decentralized strategy management platform built on blockchain
    technology and smart contracts. Blockchain technology provides indispensable
    advantages, such as openness, immutability, and censorship-resistance of all
    stored information, whereas smart contracts, which will be carrying out
    investment and proÔ¨Åt distribution, make these processes completely
    transparent and open.

  <p>
    Each strategy maker in the platform has his own Maneki token fund. The size
    of the issue depends on successful strategy statistics. The process of
    transferring funds to the maker is carried out by buying a Maneki token on
    the internal exchange.
