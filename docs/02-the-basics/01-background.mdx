    Despite the industry's continuous expansion, conventional trust management
    techniques fall short of modern investors' and managers' expectations.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to analyzing and selecting wealth managers in the market,
    transparency and low fees are two of the most essential criteria for
    customers. For example, according to Vestmark, Inc., a prominent provider of
    wealth management solutions and services in the United States, 45 percent of
    clients do not trust their advisors when it comes to charging fees for asset
    management and are unhappy with the fee structure supplied by wealth
    managers. As a result, the market is projected to be limited by a lack of
    price transparency and increased costs imposed for wealth management
    services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Managers are reliant on their brokers/exchanges, as are their investors. At
    the same time, there is no centralized, dependable source of data or
    statistics. This reduces the manager's capacity to recruit fresh money and
    gives investors less flexibility in their selections.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lack of transparency aggravates the problem even further. Brokers have
    the technological capacity to sway data from their managers' transaction
    histories and statistics. The potential investor is unable to separate
    genuine trading history from forgery, as well as the current profit graph of
    the management from the "drawn." The mechanics of investment, profit
    sharing, and commissions are concealed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In recent years, a considerable number of fraudulent practices in the trust
    management business have been discovered. Many Ponzi schemes have been set
    up under the pretext of trading currencies, stocks, and other assets.
    Fraudsters took advantage of the fact that technical solutions for trust
    management are by default complex and opaque to consumers. Customers lost
    money overnight as a result, and investor confidence in the market as a
    whole began to dwindle.
  </p>
  <p>
    The natural reaction for this situation was tightening the regulations in
    this sphere. Nowadays companies have to come a long and expensive way in
    order to obtain a licence for trust management activities. Conscientious
    companies have to implement complex and costly reporting and auditing
    systems as well as to impose serious restrictions for investors. Obviously,
    neither companies nor investors beneÔ¨Åt from that. However, offshore
    companies continue operating without license and deceiving their clients.
  </p>
  <p>
    The logical response to this circumstance was to tighten the rules in this
    area. Companies must now go through a lengthy and costly process to secure a
    license for trust management operations. Companies that are ethical must
    build extensive and expensive reporting and auditing systems, as well as
    place severe limitations on investors. Clearly, neither businesses nor
    investors benefit from this. Offshore firms, on the other hand, continue to
    operate without a license and deceive their clientele.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of these technologies, we believe, might be blockchain. On a
    technological level, the implementation of blockchain will allow the trust
    management sector to attain transparency and efficiency. This will assist in
    regaining the market's faith. It will also draw the attention of new
    businesses and investors from the new digital age.
